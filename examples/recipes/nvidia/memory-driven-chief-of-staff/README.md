# Memory-Driven Chief of Staff

Turn NemoHermes into an attention bridge for inbound conversations. This recipe
builds a source-backed work wiki and surfaces the decisions, replies, and
follow-ups that require the user's attention.

## From Message Overload to the Work That Needs You

Work arrives across threads and providers. NemoHermes rebuilds the context
needed to understand what changed and where the user must step in.

With this recipe, you can ask NemoHermes questions such as:

> **What changed on this project since yesterday?**
>
> **Which conversations need a decision, response, or follow-up from me?**
>
> **What are the most important items on my todo list today?**
>
> **What should I know about this person or project, and how does it connect to
> my work?**

NemoHermes turns the same inbound stream into one continuous workflow:

```text

                         │
                         ▼

       “What changed?”          “Where do I need to act?”
                │                         │
                └────────────┬────────────┘

                             │
              user pins · ignores · corrections
```

Answers show what changed, where the user is needed, why an item matters, and
which sources support it. A message can update the wiki without becoming a todo;
an urgent broadcast can rank below work the user has chosen.

## Memory That Tracks Work, Not Just Preferences

[Hermes built-in memory](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/website/docs/user-guide/features/memory.md)
stores compact preferences, environment facts, and lessons across sessions.

This recipe tracks the work around the person in evolving, linked pages for
people, projects, goals, patterns, concepts, and current attention. Its
scheduled writer currently maintains people and attention pages from message
evidence and user corrections. It also keeps the evidence behind non-obvious
claims and the user's corrections to message-derived obligations.

> **Hermes built-in memory:** “What should the agent know about me?”
>
> **This recipe's operational memory:** “What changed around my work, what is
> the evidence, and where does my attention matter now?”

General personalization stays compact. Operational memory can grow with the
work while remaining linked, source-backed, schema-checked, and repairable. The
recipe complements Hermes memory and optional external memory providers.

## How It Works

Hermes built-in memory remains available for general identity, preferences,
and learned facts. The recipe adds a workflow around three connected layers:

1. **Inbound signals** bring new information from configured messaging
   providers into a source-neutral format.
2. **The work wiki** organizes durable context about people, projects, goals,
   patterns, concepts, and current attention, with provenance and maintenance
   rules. Its scheduled writer currently maintains people and attention pages,
   and user-confirmed identity links connect the same person across providers.
3. **The attention layer** uses that context to identify work that requires the
   user's response, decision, or follow-up; recommend priorities; and preserve
   the user's corrections over time.

```

The model does not write SQL. It returns a versioned JSON envelope;
`apply_decisions.py` validates that envelope and applies it transactionally.
The offline walkthrough substitutes recorded envelopes only at the two points
where inference would otherwise be required. Everything downstream is the same
code used by scheduled runs.

### Core concepts

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Profile home | One Hermes profile directory, named by `HERMES_HOME` |
| Hermes built-in memory | Bounded `USER.md` and `MEMORY.md` notes for general personalization and learned facts |
| Work wiki | Schema-checked pages for people, projects, goals, patterns, concepts, and attention |
| Provenance | Source, evidence date, and trust attached to non-obvious wiki claims |
| Attention layer | Ranked recommendations for inbound work that may require the user's response, decision, or follow-up |
| Obligation ledger | Message judgments, corrections, and audit history at `$HERMES_HOME/workspace/ledger/state.db` |
| Obligation | A source message that still needs a response or action |
| Intent gate | Proof in memory that the user chose the work; required for `high` |
| Wake gate | The last non-empty selector line that tells Hermes not to call the model |
| Envelope | Versioned JSON containing model decisions for the transactional writer |

## Quick Start

This is the path that ends with a running, scheduled assistant. Steps 1
through 5 are what you run, in order, to get there. Step 6 is optional —
connect a real Slack or Outlook source instead of leaving the store empty.
Step 7 runs nothing new; it explains how to look at what steps 1-5 already
started.

The scheduled jobs run inside a Linux NemoHermes sandbox. Your own computer is
outside that sandbox and can use any platform supported by NemoHermes.

This guide uses two command locations:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
| Location | What it means | CLI available there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Your machine, outside the sandbox | The terminal with the repository checkout that you use to manage NemoHermes | `nemohermes`, `openshell` |
| NemoHermes sandbox | The isolated Linux environment where Hermes and the scheduled jobs run | `hermes` |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

A plain "gateway" in this guide always means Hermes's own `hermes gateway`
process — the agent-serving process for a profile, started explicitly in
step 5. That is a different system from the **OpenShell gateway**, the
daemon that manages this sandbox's provider credentials and refresh-token
rotation (see [docs/set-up-graph.md](docs/set-up-graph.md) and
[docs/set-up-slack.md](docs/set-up-slack.md)); this guide always spells that
one out by name.

The sandbox satisfies the recipe's Linux runtime requirement. The current
provider setup helpers still require Linux or WSL on your machine; this is a
helper-script limitation, not a recipe runtime requirement.

`scripts/install.sh` always runs inside the sandbox. Your machine is not
expected to have `hermes` on `PATH`.

### 1. Install prerequisites

This recipe assumes an existing NemoClaw-managed Hermes sandbox; it does not
cover NemoClaw onboarding itself. If NemoClaw is not installed, follow the
upstream [NemoClaw setup guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw) and select
Hermes, an inference provider, and a model during onboarding. That installer
also installs `openshell` as part of its own setup — Quick Start uses both
`nemohermes` and `openshell` on your machine below, and neither needs a
separate install.

Then, on your machine (not inside the sandbox), clone this repository and
enter it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/nemoclaw-community.git
cd nemoclaw-community
```

The remaining Quick Start steps run from this checkout.

### 2. Confirm and inspect a Hermes sandbox from your machine

```bash
nemohermes my-hermes status
openshell sandbox provider list my-hermes
```

Replace `my-hermes` in this section with your registered sandbox name.

Before starting scheduled intake, inspect every provider already attached to
the sandbox:

```bash
openshell provider get "<provider-name>"
```

Do not continue if an unrelated provider exposes `MS_GRAPH_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
The current Graph collector can see the injected environment value but cannot
identify which attached provider supplied it. Use a dedicated sandbox or
detach the conflicting provider before installing or starting the scheduled
runtime.

### 3. Upload the recipe from your machine

Run this from the `nemoclaw-community` checkout from step 1.

```bash
nemohermes sandbox upload my-hermes \
  examples/recipes/nvidia/memory-driven-chief-of-staff \
  /sandbox
nemohermes my-hermes connect
```

The upload is required: the sandbox cannot see the checkout on your machine.
After `connect` opens a shell, the remaining commands in this subsection run
**inside the sandbox**.

### 4. Install the profile and jobs inside the sandbox

```bash
cd /sandbox/memory-driven-chief-of-staff
export PROFILE_NAME="memory-driven-chief-of-staff"
bash scripts/install.sh
```

The installer creates the target profile and copies only `model.default`,
`model.provider`, and `model.base_url`. It never copies a credential. On a first
run without a target-profile credential, it
stops before registering jobs.

In a NemoClaw-managed sandbox, set the non-secret OpenShell rewrite sentinel,
then rerun the installer:

```bash
hermes -p "$PROFILE_NAME" config set model.api_key \
  "sk-OPENSHELL-PROXY-REWRITE"
bash scripts/install.sh
```

The sentinel is not an upstream API key. Hermes requires an `sk-`-prefixed
value before it sends a request, and OpenShell removes this marker and
injects the managed inference credential at the egress boundary. Use the
exact sentinel above rather than another placeholder — do not copy a real
inference key into the recipe profile on the supported NemoClaw path.

> **Not on NemoClaw, and your endpoint genuinely needs no key?** This opt-out
> is not a substitute for the rewrite sentinel above — use it only for a
> genuinely keyless, non-NemoClaw endpoint.
>
> ```bash
> ALLOW_NO_API_KEY=1 bash scripts/install.sh
> ```

### 5. Start and verify the scheduled runtime inside the sandbox

NemoClaw's own supervisor launches and continuously respawns `hermes gateway
run` for the sandbox's default profile automatically, logging to
`/tmp/gateway.log` under a `0600` file it owns. This recipe installs as a
separate, named profile (`memory-driven-chief-of-staff`), which that
supervision does not cover — there is no NemoClaw-managed lifecycle for a
second named-profile gateway today, so this step starts it manually. Hermes
records runtime state for the named profile, and its profile-scoped stop
command validates that runtime identity before it signals the process. The
separate log path below avoids colliding with the managed gateway's log. Check
first whether the named-profile gateway is already running:

```bash
hermes -p "$PROFILE_NAME" cron status
```

If it reports the gateway is not running, start it in the background,
logging to its own path — reusing `/tmp/gateway.log` would collide with
NemoClaw's managed one — and make the new log owner-only. Unlike NemoClaw's
own gateway, nothing restarts this one automatically. If it dies because of a
crash, an out-of-memory event, or a sandbox restart, cron stops firing until
you rerun this command:

```bash
umask 077
nohup hermes gateway run --profile "$PROFILE_NAME" \
  > /tmp/mdcos-gateway.log 2>&1 &
disown
hermes -p "$PROFILE_NAME" cron status
```

Piece by piece: `umask 077` makes the log file the next line creates
owner-only (`0600`), matching NemoClaw's own gateway log. `nohup … &`
backgrounds the process and makes it immune to hangup, so it keeps running
after you disconnect from the sandbox shell. The redirect targets
`/tmp/mdcos-gateway.log` — named differently from NemoClaw's own
`/tmp/gateway.log` specifically so the two logs don't collide, since NemoClaw
already writes its managed profile's gateway output there. `disown` then
drops the job from the shell's job table too, on top of what `nohup` already
protects against. The final `cron status` re-runs the same check from above,
now that the gateway should actually be up.

`cron status` should now report the gateway running and the next scheduled
job. If it still reports not running, check `/tmp/mdcos-gateway.log` for a
startup error.

The eight registered jobs drive six distinct Hermes skills — intake runs
`inbound-judging`, review runs `obligation-review`, and there are separate
`memory-writing`, `memory-repair`, `memory-consolidation`, and
`preference-update` skills; retention and skill overrides run pre-steps without
a skill. See
[Scheduled Operation](#scheduled-operation) for the full schedule and
job-to-skill table.

The work wiki those skills write lives inside the sandbox at
`$HERMES_HOME/workspace/memory/` — concretely
`/sandbox/.hermes/profiles/$PROFILE_NAME/workspace/memory/` for this recipe's
default profile name. The obligation ledger the intake and review jobs work
from lives alongside it, at `$HERMES_HOME/workspace/ledger/state.db`.

> **`cron status` shows the gateway running but no scheduled job?** The jobs
> were never registered — for example if step 4 stopped at the credential
> check before reaching its `4/4 Registering scheduled jobs` phase. Do not
> run `register-jobs.sh` directly to fix that: it checks only the platform
> and that the profile exists, not that a credential is set, so it would
> schedule all eight jobs against a profile that fails authentication on
> every run. Verify the credential first, then rerun the installer, which
> registers jobs as its own last step once the credential check passes:
>
> ```bash
> hermes -p "$PROFILE_NAME" config get model.api_key
> bash scripts/install.sh
> ```
>
> Once you know the credential is already set, `bash scripts/register-jobs.sh`
> on its own is safe to resync job definitions — it is idempotent, so
> rerunning it updates existing jobs in place rather than duplicating them.

To remove every registered job at once instead of one at a time, see
[Persistence and reboot behavior](#persistence-and-reboot-behavior).

To stop it later, use Hermes's profile-scoped lifecycle command:

```bash
hermes gateway stop --profile "$PROFILE_NAME"
```

Hermes scopes the stop to the selected profile and checks its recorded runtime
identity instead of trusting a shell PID file. Deleting the profile already
stops this gateway and its related backends as part of deletion — an
explicit stop first is not required, but it is harmless and can make
[teardown](#persistence-and-reboot-behavior) easier to verify.

> **Running this outside a NemoClaw sandbox, on a host with systemd?** Any
> environment without a running systemd — WSL included — still needs the
> foreground command above. Only where systemd is actually running does
> `gateway install` register it as a persistent service instead. See
> [Persistence and reboot behavior](#persistence-and-reboot-behavior) for the
> trade-off against `gateway run`.
>
> ```bash
> hermes gateway install --profile "$PROFILE_NAME"
> hermes gateway start --profile "$PROFILE_NAME"
> ```

At this point the schedule works over any rows already in the store. Slack and
Outlook are independent and optional; each unconfigured collector exits
successfully and reports that state.

### 6. Connect a messaging provider (optional)

Step 5 leaves you inside the sandbox shell. Exit it (or open a separate
terminal on your machine) before continuing — `openshell` and `nemohermes`
are host-side commands and are not available inside the sandbox.

Nothing so far requires a provider — the profile, jobs, and gateway all work
with an empty store. But an empty store is exactly what you will see if you
chat with it next: no messages ingested, nothing to rank. Check what is
already attached first, from your machine:

```bash
openshell sandbox provider list my-hermes
```

If nothing there exposes `SLACK_USER_TOKEN` or `MS_GRAPH_ACCESS_TOKEN`,
connect one now — see [Connect Messaging Providers](#connect-messaging-providers)
below for the full Slack and Outlook setup. Both are optional and
independent; connect one, both, or skip this step and use the
[offline fixtures](#offline-walkthrough-no-deployment) instead to see the
recipe's behavior without connecting anything.

### 7. A note on the web dashboard (reference — nothing to run)

Nothing in this step is required to finish Quick Start; it explains what is
already reachable from steps above and how to look at it.

From your machine, not inside the sandbox, this prints the URL for the
Hermes dashboard NemoClaw already forwards for the sandbox by default —
already reachable, with no forwarding step of your own:

```bash
nemohermes my-hermes dashboard-url --quiet
```

That dashboard is a **machine-level** surface: a profile switcher lets it
manage any profile on the sandbox, including this recipe's
`memory-driven-chief-of-staff`. `--isolated` (used when NemoClaw launches
this dashboard) changes only how the `hermes dashboard` command routes on
launch — whether it reuses an already-running shared server or starts its
own — not what a running dashboard's pages can reach. Selecting this
recipe's profile, through the switcher or a
`?profile=memory-driven-chief-of-staff` URL, routes **Config, API Keys,
Skills, MCP, Models, and Chat** to it — including starting a brand-new chat
session as it, from the browser. **Sessions** is likewise scoped to whichever
profile is currently selected, rather than showing every profile at once.

**Cron** and **Profiles** are the two pages that are not scoped by the
switcher:

- **Cron** defaults to showing every registered job across every profile,
  with its full prompt text, schedule, delivery target, and
  Pause/Resume/Edit/Trigger-now/Delete.
- **Profiles** always lists every profile globally as a management card
  (model, skill count, gateway state, description), with **Rename** and
  **Delete** — deleting from here removes the workspace, store, and memory
  the same as `hermes profile delete` does. See
  [Persistence and reboot behavior](#persistence-and-reboot-behavior).

So this one forwarded URL already gives you full access to this recipe's
profile once you select it — chat, config, sessions, plus the always-visible
cron jobs and destructive profile management — with no extra step. Hermes
uses session auth for this dashboard, so the printed URL is a plain link, not
a credential, but treat it as sensitive regardless: protect access to it
through the sandbox's normal session controls, and do not expose it publicly.

If you don't have that URL handy, it is safe to rerun the command above at
any time.

Prefer the terminal to the browser? This is the verified way to talk to this
recipe directly, from inside the sandbox — no dashboard, no forwarding,
nothing above needed:

```bash
hermes -p memory-driven-chief-of-staff chat
```

### Things to try

Once real data is flowing, ask it the questions from the top of this
document:

> **What changed on this project since yesterday?**
>
> **Which conversations need a decision, response, or follow-up from me?**
>
> **What are the most important items on my todo list today?**
>
> **What should I know about this person or project, and how does it connect
> to my work?**

Then push on the ranking itself — this is where the intent gate shows up:

- "Why is this ranked above that?"
- "What's urgent right now that I haven't actually chosen to work on?"

Ask it to ground a claim in evidence rather than answer from general recall:

- "What should I know about [a real colleague]? How does it connect to my
  current work?"
- "What did [someone] say this week?"

And after you correct something (`priority ... low` or `ignore ...` via
`profile/scripts/correct.py`), ask again without re-explaining the
correction — it should already be reflected.

## Connect Messaging Providers

Slack and Microsoft Outlook are independent, optional inputs. Configure either
one or both after installing the recipe and setting any intake exclusions.
Each setup script requires encrypted sandbox storage and attaches a read-only
OpenShell provider to the NemoHermes sandbox.

Both setup scripts require `SANDBOX_STORAGE_PATH`: the **host-side** path
where this sandbox's storage actually lives, not a path inside the sandbox
and not `$HOME`. Once a connector is attached, real message subjects,
senders, and bodies land in the store, and that requires the underlying
volume to be encrypted — a check `require-encrypted-storage.sh` cannot make
from inside the sandbox, since `HERMES_HOME` there is an overlay filesystem
with no block device behind it. There is no default: where the sandbox's
storage actually lives depends on the driver. For the Docker driver, discover
it with `docker info --format '{{.DockerRootDir}}'` (commonly
`/var/lib/docker` on a stock install, but not guaranteed — always verify
rather than assume). See [docs/encrypted-storage.md](docs/encrypted-storage.md)
for the VM and Kubernetes drivers and how to verify the volume is encrypted.

### Profile configuration

The installer has already created the target profile from
`profile/distribution.yaml`. Its model block should have this shape:

```yaml
model:
  default: "<provider/model>"
  provider: "<provider>"
  base_url: "<https-endpoint>"
  api_key: sk-OPENSHELL-PROXY-REWRITE
```

The `api_key` value is the non-secret routing marker configured during
installation. OpenShell replaces it at egress; it is not a credential to rotate
or hide.

Provider setup now continues on **your machine, outside the sandbox**. The
current setup helpers require a Linux shell; use WSL on Windows.

### Slack

Slack setup is optional. Complete it only after placing the sandbox storage on
an encrypted volume; owner-only permissions are access control, not encryption.
See [docs/encrypted-storage.md](docs/encrypted-storage.md) first.

Run the setup script from the recipe checkout on **your machine**, not inside
the sandbox. Your machine has `openshell`; the sandbox has `hermes`.

```bash
export SANDBOX_STORAGE_PATH="<path-containing-sandbox-storage>"
export OPENSHELL_SANDBOX_NAME="my-hermes"
bash scripts/setup-slack.sh
```

The script imports
[docs/slack_app_manifest.json](docs/slack_app_manifest.json), requests user
scopes, checks the provider type and read-only policy, configures token
rotation, and attaches the provider to the named sandbox. The required scopes
are:

```yaml
user_scopes:
  - im:read
  - im:history
  - mpim:read
  - mpim:history
  - channels:read
  - channels:history
  - users:read
```

Static user tokens, bot tokens, and app tokens are refused. Attachments are not
downloaded. Full setup and workspace-admin recovery steps are in
[docs/set-up-slack.md](docs/set-up-slack.md).

Verify the live collector from your machine through the supported sandbox exec
path. Replace both placeholders.

```bash
nemohermes my-hermes exec \
  --workdir /sandbox/memory-driven-chief-of-staff \
  -- env HERMES_HOME=/sandbox/.hermes/profiles/memory-driven-chief-of-staff \
  python3 profile/scripts/ingest_slack.py --recheck
```

Collector exit codes are stable diagnostics:

| Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Fetch succeeded, or Slack is intentionally unconfigured |
| `1` | Other collector error |
| `2` | Missing/wrong credential type or unreachable API |
| `3` | Slack rate limit |
| `4` | Required Slack scope missing |

### Microsoft Outlook

Outlook intake uses the Microsoft Graph inbox delta API. Register a Microsoft
Entra application with public-client flows enabled and delegated `Mail.Read`,
`User.Read`, and `offline_access` permissions. Do not grant application-level
mail permissions, which would authorize access beyond the signed-in mailbox.

Run the device-code setup from the recipe checkout on your machine:

```bash
export SANDBOX_STORAGE_PATH="<path-containing-sandbox-storage>"
export OPENSHELL_SANDBOX_NAME="my-hermes"
export GRAPH_CLIENT_ID="<entra-application-client-id>"
export GRAPH_TENANT_ID="<entra-directory-tenant-id>"
bash scripts/setup-graph.sh
```

If the script reports that another attached provider already exposes
`MS_GRAPH_ACCESS_TOKEN`, treat that as a hard stop. Detach the conflicting
provider or use a dedicated sandbox, then rerun setup. Do not run the Graph
collector while the credential source is ambiguous.

On the supported path, the OpenShell gateway stores and refreshes the
delegated credential, and the sandbox receives only an OpenShell placeholder. Confirm
that the attached provider has type `memory-driven-cos-graph-user` and that its
exported profile declares `access: read-only` with `enforcement: enforce` before
running the collector. The initial synchronization covers seven days by default
and resumes across intake ticks when more pages remain. Configure a different
`GRAPH_BACKFILL_DAYS` in the profile environment file before the first
synchronization. See [docs/set-up-graph.md](docs/set-up-graph.md) for the
application registration, provider inspection, backfill, revocation, and
recovery steps.

### Link identities across providers

Slack identifies a person by user ID, while email uses an address. The recipe
never assumes that matching display names belong to the same person. The memory
job reports likely matches as `identity_candidates`; only the user can confirm
or reject them.

Run the identity command from your machine through sandbox exec:

```bash
nemohermes my-hermes exec \
  --workdir /sandbox/memory-driven-chief-of-staff \
  -- env HERMES_HOME=/sandbox/.hermes/profiles/memory-driven-chief-of-staff \
  python3 profile/scripts/link_identity.py same \
    slack:U01DANA email:dana@example.com
```

Use `different` instead of `same` to reject a match. Confirmed relationships
compose across providers. Rejected candidates are not proposed again. If saved
answers conflict, the recipe reports `identity_conflicts` and changes nothing.
Existing page names remain stable after identities are linked so that index
entries and source-backed links do not move.

### Collector failures

When a collector fails, the intake batch records only its name, exit code, and
error class. It does not place collector output in the model prompt or the
scheduler log because that output can contain message text or authentication
material. Run the collector directly to inspect its full error.

Verify the collector from your machine:

```bash
nemohermes my-hermes exec \
  --workdir /sandbox/memory-driven-chief-of-staff \
  -- env HERMES_HOME=/sandbox/.hermes/profiles/memory-driven-chief-of-staff \
  python3 profile/scripts/ingest_graph.py --recheck
```

Outlook collector exit codes are:

| Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Fetch succeeded, can resume, or Outlook is unconfigured |
| `1` | Other collector error |
| `2` | Missing, invalid, or refused credential |
| `3` | Microsoft Graph rate limit |
| `4` | Token is not a delegated mailbox token with the required scopes |

## Offline Walkthrough (No Deployment)

This does not deploy the recipe or produce a running assistant. It runs the
decision logic — ranking, the intent gate, correction durability, memory
self-checks — entirely on your own machine against recorded fixtures, with no
NemoClaw, no sandbox, no credentials, and no network access. Use it to verify
the recipe's behavior before investing in a real deployment, or skip straight
to [Quick Start](#quick-start) above if you already have a sandbox ready.

It needs only Python 3.10+ on macOS, Linux, or WSL.

### 1. Clone and enter the recipe

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/nemoclaw-community.git
cd nemoclaw-community/examples/recipes/nvidia/memory-driven-chief-of-staff
```

### 2. Create isolated local state and run the walkthrough

```bash
export RECIPE_TMP_HOME="$(mktemp -d)"
export HERMES_HOME="$RECIPE_TMP_HOME"
python3 profile/scripts/walkthrough.py --fixtures fixtures
```

The command prints seven stages and exits with status `0`. The important
outcomes are:

- eight messages are ingested and two are skipped;
- six obligations remain open;
- exactly three memory-gated obligations enter `high`;
- an urgent deadline unrelated to the user's chosen work stays in `medium`;
- a user pin and ignore survive a later recorded review;
- the memory checker is shown succeeding and failing on a deliberate defect.

### 3. Prove fixture ingestion is idempotent

Use a new profile home because the walkthrough has already populated the first
one.

```bash
export RECIPE_TMP_HOME_2="$(mktemp -d)"
export HERMES_HOME="$RECIPE_TMP_HOME_2"
python3 profile/scripts/load_fixtures.py --fixtures fixtures
python3 profile/scripts/load_fixtures.py --fixtures fixtures
```

The first loader run reports `"added": 8`; the second reports `"added": 0`.

### 4. Inspect or correct state

Replace the placeholder with a source identifier printed by the walkthrough.

```bash
python3 profile/scripts/memory_check.py
python3 profile/scripts/correct.py priority msg-priorities-match low
python3 profile/scripts/correct.py ignore msg-cc-only
python3 profile/scripts/correct.py unignore msg-cc-only
```

Repeated corrections are no-ops. Corrections against completed or incompatible
rows exit with status `3` and explain the required state transition.

## Configuration

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Scheduled environment variables must reach the target profile. Persist a value
through the profile environment file returned by Hermes rather than relying on
a temporary shell export. See [docs/data-lifecycle.md](docs/data-lifecycle.md)
for retention and memory settings, and
[docs/set-up-graph.md](docs/set-up-graph.md) for Outlook backfill.

### Public Slack channels

Direct messages and group DMs are discovered automatically. Public channels
are read only when explicitly listed at
`$HERMES_HOME/workspace/slack_channels.json`.

```json
{
  "channels": ["C0TEAM0001", "C0PROJECT2"]
}
```

### Ingest exclusions

Create `$HERMES_HOME/workspace/exclusions.json` to prevent matching rows from
ever reaching the store. Matching is exact and case-insensitive; glob patterns
are not supported. Invalid or unknown fields fail closed.

```json
{
  "senders": ["recruiter@agency.example", "U01RECRUIT"],
  "domains": ["agency.example"],
  "channels": ["C0SALARY01", "D0PRIVATE1"]
}
```

## Scheduled Operation

`scripts/register-jobs.sh` is idempotent: it edits jobs with matching names
instead of creating duplicates.

| Job | Schedule | Pre-step | Skill |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| intake | every 30 minutes | `select_intake.py` | `inbound-judging` |
| review | every 6 hours | `select_review.py` | `obligation-review` |
| memory writing | daily 01:00 | `select_memory.py` | `memory-writing` |
| retention | daily 02:00 | `retention.py` | — |
| memory repair | daily 03:00 | — | `memory-repair` |
| memory consolidation | daily 04:00 | — | `memory-consolidation` |
| preference update | daily 04:30 | — | `preference-update` |
| skill overrides | hourly at :15 | `skill_overrides.py` | — |

Intake, review, and memory writing run their selector before an agent turn. If
no work is available, the selector's final non-empty line is the wake gate and
Hermes skips inference. Retention and skill overrides never wake the agent —
neither involves judgment. Memory writing runs before repair and consolidation
so every new page is checked and compacted in the same nightly sequence.

### Persistence and reboot behavior

Jobs live in `$HERMES_HOME/cron/jobs.json`. The distribution does not own the
`cron` path, so profile updates leave job definitions and run history unchanged.

Jobs survive a reboot. Do they resume automatically?
Only if the gateway was installed as a service with `gateway install`. A
gateway started with `gateway run` is a foreground process and must be started
again after a reboot.

What happens to recurring runs missed while the gateway was down? One of them
runs, not the entire backlog. Hermes advances the schedule and runs once over
current state. A machine that was off for two days does not wake to ninety-six
intake runs; it wakes to one and then resumes its half-hourly schedule.

List or remove registered jobs inside the sandbox.

```bash
hermes -p memory-driven-chief-of-staff cron list
JOB_ID="<copy-an-id-from-the-list>"
hermes -p memory-driven-chief-of-staff cron remove "$JOB_ID"
```

There is no single `cron` subcommand that removes every job at once — `cron
list` prints a table for a person, not machine-readable output. To remove all
of them, read each job's id from the profile's own job store instead, the same
file `register-jobs.sh` itself reads to stay idempotent, and remove them in a
loop:

```bash
PROFILE_HOME="$(hermes profile show memory-driven-chief-of-staff \
  | sed -n 's/^Path:[[:space:]]*//p')"
python3 -c '
import json, sys
with open(sys.argv[1], encoding="utf-8") as handle:
    data = json.load(handle)
for job in data.get("jobs", []):
    print(job["id"])
' "$PROFILE_HOME/cron/jobs.json" | while read -r JOB_ID; do
  hermes -p memory-driven-chief-of-staff cron remove "$JOB_ID"
done
```

Deleting the profile also deletes its workspace, store, and memory. Hermes
already stops the profile's gateway and related backends as part of
deletion, so a separate stop is not required — but if you started one by
hand (step 5 of Quick Start), stopping it explicitly first is harmless and
makes teardown easier to verify:

```bash
hermes gateway stop --profile memory-driven-chief-of-staff
hermes profile delete memory-driven-chief-of-staff
```

## Data Lifecycle and Privacy

**Network boundary:** the offline walkthrough makes no network requests.
Scheduled jobs call the configured inference endpoint only when work is found.
The shipped provider profiles declare read-only access to `slack.com` and
`graph.microsoft.com`, and the shipped collectors contain no source-system
write operations.

> **Runtime provenance limitation:** the effective network boundary is the
> policy of the provider actually attached to the sandbox, not the YAML file in
> this checkout. `ingest_graph.py` currently trusts whichever attached provider
> supplies `MS_GRAPH_ACCESS_TOKEN`; it does not verify the provider name, type,
> or policy at runtime. A different provider exposing the same key can therefore
> bypass the setup-time refusal. Inspect the attached providers on your machine
> and do not run Graph intake unless the effective provider is the recipe's
> read-only, enforced profile.

**Source-system behavior:** the shipped collectors read Slack and the signed-in
Outlook mailbox but do not post, reply, edit, delete, move, or mark messages as
read. This describes the collector code; it is not a claim that an unrelated
read-write provider attached to the same sandbox would refuse writes from other
code.

- The offline fixtures are entirely synthetic and make no network request.
- Recipient lists are reduced to `direct`, `mentioned`, or `broadcast` and are
  never stored.
- Message bodies are cleared after 30 days by default; metadata, obligation
  state, and audit history remain.
- Exclusions are enforced at the shared insert boundary, before a row reaches
  the store.
- Export includes the complete store, memory, and learned policy in Markdown
  and JSON.
- Slack content deleted at the source is not detected immediately because a
  bounded history read cannot distinguish deletion from an older page. It ages
  out through retention.
- Outlook messages removed from the inbox are reconciled through Microsoft
  Graph. A confirmed deletion is tombstoned and its body is cleared immediately;
  the metadata, obligation, and audit history remain. A move to another folder
  is not treated as a deletion.
- Microsoft Graph files in `fixtures/` remain synthetic and exercise the same
  normalization path without contacting a mailbox.

The store and memory directories are created with owner-only permissions. That
does not protect a lost disk, disk image, or unencrypted backup. Before
connecting Slack or Outlook, follow
[docs/encrypted-storage.md](docs/encrypted-storage.md).

## Troubleshooting and FAQ

### `HERMES_HOME` is unset, missing, or points at the checkout

Stateful scripts require an existing profile-like directory and refuse a file,
a missing path, or an occupied non-profile directory. For an offline run, make
a fresh directory and export it first.

```bash
export HERMES_HOME="$(mktemp -d)"
```

### The walkthrough refuses a second run

The walkthrough demonstrates a clean first run and rejects state that contains
old corrections. Create a new temporary profile home.

```bash
export HERMES_HOME="$(mktemp -d)"
python3 profile/scripts/walkthrough.py --fixtures fixtures
```

### Collector tests try to reach the real network or report HTTP 503

The Slack and Outlook tests use local HTTP stand-ins at `127.0.0.1`. If your
shell sets a proxy without a localhost bypass, the proxy can intercept those
requests. The documented test command extends both `NO_PROXY` and `no_proxy`;
for an individual test, apply the same bypass first.

```bash
export NO_PROXY="${NO_PROXY:+$NO_PROXY,}127.0.0.1,localhost"
export no_proxy="${no_proxy:+$no_proxy,}127.0.0.1,localhost"
python3 profile/scripts/tests/test_ingest_slack.py
python3 profile/scripts/tests/test_ingest_graph.py
```

### The installer says the platform is unsupported

The offline path runs on macOS, Linux, and WSL. Scheduled skills require the
Linux environment inside a NemoHermes sandbox. If `scripts/install.sh` reports
another platform, run it inside the sandbox rather than on your machine.

### The installer reports no model or API credential

The new profile receives three model routing settings but never a copied
secret. Set `model.default` if the source profile had none. On NemoClaw, set the
OpenShell rewrite sentinel as the target profile's `model.api_key`, then rerun
the installer.

```bash
MODEL_ID="<provider/model>"
hermes -p memory-driven-chief-of-staff \
  config set model.default "$MODEL_ID"
hermes -p memory-driven-chief-of-staff \
  config set model.api_key "sk-OPENSHELL-PROXY-REWRITE"
bash scripts/install.sh
```

The sentinel is a non-secret routing marker. Do not use
`ALLOW_NO_API_KEY=1` for a NemoClaw-managed inference route.

### How do I check whether my API key actually works, and replace it if not?

The real key does not live in this recipe's profile — the sentinel above is
not a credential. Check and rotate it at the NemoClaw/OpenShell layer, from
your machine, not inside the sandbox:

```bash
nemohermes my-hermes inference get
```

This reports the configured provider and model, but sends no request, so it
cannot tell you whether the key is valid. The global `nemohermes status`
(no sandbox name) cannot either — that reachability check counts HTTP
`401`/`403` as "reachable." The named-sandbox form does validate it, because
it sends one real inference request through the stored credential:

```bash
nemohermes my-hermes status
```

It reports `unauthorized` when that request is rejected with `401`/`403`.
For a final, recipe-level confirmation, also try a real chat turn inside the
sandbox:

```bash
hermes -p memory-driven-chief-of-staff chat
```

A real reply means the key works; an authentication error means it does not.

If it is wrong, replace it from your machine — do not edit the recipe
profile's `model.api_key`, which only ever holds the non-secret rewrite
sentinel. Export the replacement under the environment variable name your
configured provider expects, then rerun onboarding for the existing sandbox:

```bash
printf 'New inference API key: ' >&2
IFS= read -r -s PROVIDER_API_KEY_VAR_NAME
printf '\n' >&2
export PROVIDER_API_KEY_VAR_NAME
nemohermes onboard --name my-hermes \
  --non-interactive --yes --yes-i-accept-third-party-software
unset PROVIDER_API_KEY_VAR_NAME
```

`PROVIDER_API_KEY_VAR_NAME` above is a placeholder — substitute the actual
variable name your provider expects (this differs by provider; NemoClaw's
own credential rotation guide lists them). This updates the registered
OpenShell provider and normally reuses the existing sandbox; it does not
touch this recipe's installed profile or its scheduled jobs. Confirm the
replacement the same way — `nemohermes my-hermes status` or a real request,
not `inference get` or the global `status`.

### Jobs are registered but do not run

Registration does not start the scheduler. Check the gateway and cron status.

```bash
hermes gateway status --profile memory-driven-chief-of-staff
hermes -p memory-driven-chief-of-staff cron status
```

Install and start the service, or use the foreground command shown in
[Quick Start](#quick-start).

### A collector reports `unconfigured`

That is a supported state. The scheduler continues over existing store rows.
Enable the source by running `scripts/setup-slack.sh` or
`scripts/setup-graph.sh` on your machine, then run its collector with
`--recheck` through sandbox exec.

### Provider setup says `openshell` is missing

The setup command is running inside the sandbox or on a machine without
OpenShell. Return to the checkout on your machine and confirm the CLI and
sandbox name.

```bash
command -v openshell
openshell sandbox list
```

### Slack is rate-limited or missing a scope

The collector exits `3` for a rate limit and `4` for a missing scope. Reduce
the named public channels or call budget for rate limits. For missing scopes,
have the workspace administrator grant the manifest scopes, reinstall the app,
and replace the rotating credential as described in
[docs/set-up-slack.md](docs/set-up-slack.md).

### Outlook synchronization is incomplete, rate-limited, or rejected

`"complete": false` means the bounded initial synchronization will resume on
the next intake tick. Exit `3` means Microsoft Graph rate-limited the current
round. Exit `4` means the token is not a delegated mailbox token with the
required `Mail.Read` and `User.Read` scopes. Follow the recovery steps in
[docs/set-up-graph.md](docs/set-up-graph.md).

### Graph setup refuses an attached provider with the same credential key

Treat the refusal as a provider collision. From your machine, inspect and
detach the conflicting provider or use a dedicated sandbox before starting
Graph intake.

```bash
openshell sandbox provider list my-hermes
openshell provider get "<provider-name>"
```

### Does the recipe modify Outlook or Slack?

The shipped collectors do not. They normalize source records into a local
SQLite store and contain no post, reply, move, delete, or mark-as-read calls.
The shipped provider profiles also declare read-only access. However, verify
the provider actually attached to the sandbox: the current Graph collector
cannot attest which provider supplied `MS_GRAPH_ACCESS_TOKEN`, so a foreign
read-write provider would make the platform-level write-refusal claim false.

## Limitations and Support

- Scheduled jobs require the Linux environment inside a NemoHermes sandbox.
  The current provider setup helpers require Linux or WSL on your machine.
- Recorded judgment turns test the workflow, not model quality.
- Live connectors currently cover Slack and a Microsoft Outlook inbox through
  Microsoft Graph. Other messaging providers need their own collector and
  OpenShell provider policy.
- Graph credential provenance is not yet enforced at collector runtime. An
  unrelated attached provider exposing `MS_GRAPH_ACCESS_TOKEN` can be used even
  after `setup-graph.sh` refuses it. Use a dedicated sandbox or remove the
  collision before enabling Graph intake.
- Slack deletion is not observed immediately; retention clears old bodies.
- The scheduled writer maintains people and attention pages. Other page types
  have schemas but no automatic writer.
- Memory compaction is model-guided. `memory_check.py` detects invariant and
  ceiling violations but does not invent a safe consolidation.
- Append-only reranking events are not compacted.
- This is a reference recipe for one user's work stream on a machine they
  control, not a hosted service or a production-readiness claim.

### API and Module Reference

#### Decision envelope

`apply_decisions.py` reads one JSON document from standard input. The supported
decisions are `CREATE`, `KEEP_OPEN`, `MARK_DONE`, and `SKIP`. A create or keep
decision requires a rank, title, and intent-gate verdict.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "pass": "intake",
  "decisions": [
    {
      "source_id": "msg-priorities-match",
      "decision": "CREATE",
      "rank": 1,
      "intent_gated": true,
      "title": "Review the migration plan",
      "context": "Matches a current priority",
      "urgency_reason": "Requested before the planning review",
      "kind": "response",
      "est_effort": "minutes"
    },
    {
      "source_id": "msg-automated-noise",
      "decision": "SKIP"
    }
  ],
  "cursor": {
    "source": "email",
    "scope": "inbox",
    "value": "synthetic-cursor"
  }
}
```

Run the writer against a saved envelope from the recipe root.

```bash
python3 profile/scripts/apply_decisions.py < /path/to/envelope.json
```

Valid optional values are:

```yaml
kind:
  - response
  - action
  - null
est_effort:
  - minutes
  - hours
  - day
  - multi_day
  - null
```

#### Store and migration commands

```bash
python3 profile/scripts/retention.py --dry-run
python3 profile/scripts/retention.py
python3 profile/scripts/export_store.py --to /path/to/export
python3 profile/scripts/migrate.py --check
python3 profile/scripts/migrate.py
python3 profile/scripts/reset.py --dry-run
python3 profile/scripts/reset.py --yes
python3 profile/scripts/skill_overrides.py --fork <skill>    # start an override from the shipped copy
python3 profile/scripts/skill_overrides.py --check           # report what --apply would do
python3 profile/scripts/skill_overrides.py --apply           # validate and apply every override
python3 profile/scripts/skill_overrides.py --remove <skill>  # delete an override, restore the latest shipped version
```

`reset.py --yes` is destructive. Stop or pause the schedule first, export if
needed, detach and revoke external credentials separately, and verify the
profile named by `HERMES_HOME` before running it.

The `skill_overrides.py` commands customize a shipped skill's
instructions and keep the change across a `hermes profile install`/`update`.
The installer registers bases from its reviewed source. After a bare profile
update, use `--record-distribution /path/to/reviewed/recipe/profile` before
applying overrides. Unknown live content is blocked; a changed accepted base
requires review and rebase. Exports include `skill-overrides-recovery.json`;
`--restore /path/to/export/skill-overrides-recovery.json` restores override
state into an empty destination without replacing live skills.
See [docs/skill-overrides.md](docs/skill-overrides.md) for the canonical edit
location, when an override actually takes effect, the full table of statuses
and exit codes, what happens when the shipped skill moves on since a fork,
the rollback and export/restore story, and how this relates to the
skill-evolution module proposed in #159.

### Verification

This is an integration-level reference implementation. Its evidence includes
an offline end-to-end walkthrough, deterministic tests, scheduled Linux
validation, plus live Slack and Outlook collector and credential-rotation
validation.

#### Offline acceptance walkthrough

```bash
export RECIPE_VERIFY_HOME="$(mktemp -d)"
export HERMES_HOME="$RECIPE_VERIFY_HOME"
python3 profile/scripts/walkthrough.py --fixtures fixtures
```

#### Full test suite

Run from the recipe root. Each test file is executed directly because some
tests verify direct-execution behavior.

```bash
cd profile/scripts
export NO_PROXY="${NO_PROXY:+$NO_PROXY,}127.0.0.1,localhost"
export no_proxy="${no_proxy:+$no_proxy,}127.0.0.1,localhost"
fail=0
for t in tests/*.py; do python3 "$t" || fail=1; done
echo "failed=$fail"
cd ../..
test "$fail" -eq 0
```

Expected result: every file ends with `OK`, the sixteen files report 733 tests
in total, and the final line is `failed=0`. Do not shorten the loop with an
early break; running every module is part of the documented check.

The suite covers schema migration, memory invariants, concurrency and crash
recovery, deterministic ranking, preference thresholds, normalization,
transactional decisions, correction state transitions, the walkthrough,
intake, review, and memory-writing selector wake gates, scheduler contracts,
lifecycle controls, and Slack and Outlook collection/rotation behavior.
