# Stage the profile into a Hermes runtime and make it runnable.
#
# Four steps. The third is the one a reader skips: a freshly
# installed profile has no model configuration, so every agent-backed job fails
# on its first tick with "no model configured". The runtime already knows which
# model to use, so the profile inherits that rather than the recipe asking the
# reader to configure it twice.
#
# No file is copied. The model settings are carried over key by key through
# `hermes config set`; the credential is not, because a credential is not a
# thing to copy. It is also not inherited, so the target profile needs its own
# and this script refuses to register jobs until it has one.

# Refuse before anything is installed or registered rather than after.

# Named settings through the CLI, never a copy of the file.
#
# Copying `config.yaml` wholesale duplicated a credential for no benefit. The
# `model:` block is documented to hold an inline `api_key`, and a generated
# config really does put one there — on the NemoClaw runtime this recipe was
# checked against, `model:` carries `default`, `provider`, `base_url` and
# `api_key` together. A wholesale copy writes that key into a second file.
#
# What the three settings do not carry is a credential, and nothing else
# supplies one either — see the check below.
# Fail closed on every one of them. `set -e` does not exit when a command fails
# as the left operand of `&&` — `false && echo` is a no-op, not an abort — so
# writing this as `config set … && echo …` swallowed the failure. A profile
# that took `model.default` and silently dropped `provider` and `base_url`
# passed both checks below and got all eight jobs registered, pointed at
# whatever route it had left.
# What a profile holds instead of a key when an OpenShell gateway substitutes
# the credential at the boundary. A public constant, not a secret — it is only
# ever compared against and echoed when it matches.
