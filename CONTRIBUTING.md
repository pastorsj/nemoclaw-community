# Contributing to NemoClaw Community

Thank you for your interest in improving NemoClaw Community.

This repository contains NemoClaw examples and developer tools. You can deploy
each runnable example independently. Documentation-only tutorials state that
they have no runtime deployment.

By participating, you agree to follow our
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Do not report security vulnerabilities in public issues or pull requests.
Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead.

## Ways to Contribute

Use one of these methods to contribute:

- Improve an example or its documentation.
- Fix setup, checks, teardown, or sandbox lifecycle problems.
- Add or improve agent skills, policies, integrations, or developer tools.
- Contribute a new example.
- Report a reproducible problem.

For a problem report, identify the example. Give sanitized environment details.

Select an example from the [example catalog](examples/README.md). Read the
example's README. Follow all linked setup and check instructions.

Discuss each of these changes with maintainers before implementation:

- A major feature or scope change.
- A new dependency.
- A distribution change.
- Publication of a container image.
- A change to the project license or compliance requirements.

For more information, read [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).

## Classify Issues And Pull Requests

Use native GitHub Issue Type for issue classification. Select `Bug` for broken
behavior, `Enhancement` for a new capability, `Task` for maintainer work, and
`Documentation` for missing or incorrect documentation. Labels route work; they
do not replace native Issue Type.

Use a Conventional Commit-style title for issues and pull requests:

```text
<type>(<optional-scope>): <description>
```

Allowed types are `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, and
`perf`. Examples include `feat(gitlab): add policy-scoped read access`,
`fix(outlook): reuse the refresh-token cache`, and `docs: clarify setup`.

Read the canonical
[maintainer taxonomy](.agents/skills/nemoclaw-community-maintainer-policies/references/label-taxonomy.md)
before suggesting or applying labels. New example proposals and publication
pull requests also follow the repository's example-kind and provenance labels.

## Prerequisites

Install these tools before you run repository checks:

- Git.
- Python 3.10 or newer. Use the `python3` command.
- Node.js 22 for catalog or Pages changes.

Some examples require a newer Python version, additional software, credentials,
or external service access. The software can include Docker, `uv`, Helm, or
Bash.

Follow the prerequisites in the README for each example that you modify.

## Create a Fork and Branch

If you do not have write access to the NVIDIA repository, first create a fork
on GitHub.

Use these commands to clone your fork and create a branch:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-user>/nemoclaw-community.git
cd nemoclaw-community
git remote add upstream https://github.com/NVIDIA/nemoclaw-community.git
git fetch upstream main
git checkout -b <short-branch-name> upstream/main
```

Use this command to push the branch to your fork:

```bash
git push -u origin <short-branch-name>
```

Before you open or update a pull request, refresh the upstream reference:

```bash
git fetch upstream main
```

### Update a Published Branch

NemoClaw Community does not allow force pushes. After you publish a branch or
use it for a pull request, do not run `git push --force` or
`git push --force-with-lease`.

Merge the current `main` branch into your published branch, then push the new
commits normally:

```bash
git checkout <short-branch-name>
git fetch upstream main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin <short-branch-name>
```

Resolve merge conflicts in the merge commit. Do not rebase a published branch
when pushing the result would rewrite remote history.

If a published branch contains a commit that must be removed or replaced,
create a new branch from the current `main` branch. Apply only the intended
changes to the new branch, push it, and open a new pull request. Close the old
pull request with a comment that identifies the replacement pull request.

Use the same process for branches in forks, even when the fork does not enforce
the repository rule.

If the example uses a Git submodule, initialize the submodule as specified in
the example's README. You do not need to initialize submodules for unrelated
examples.

## Work Within an Example

This repository does not have one shared runtime setup. Each example defines
its own development and verification workflow.

Follow the selected example's instructions for these items:

- Prerequisites and supported environments.
- Credentials and secret handling.
- Setup and configuration.
- Sandbox, network, and policy permissions.
- Startup and shutdown.
- Verification and tests.
- Cleanup and teardown.
- Known limitations.

Keep each runnable example independently deployable. Do not make an example
depend on private files, internal systems, or local state from another example.
For a documentation-only tutorial, keep its canonical content in an adjacent
root `tutorial.md`. Declare the primary runtime documented by the tutorial, and
use `N/A` only for components that do not participate.

## Contribution Requirements

Limit each pull request to one feature, fix, documentation update, or
coordinated migration.

Apply these conditional requirements:

- When behavior changes, add or update tests.
- When setup, configuration, policy, permissions, or user-visible behavior
  changes, update the documentation.
- If the change does not require a third-party dependency, do not add one.
- When dependencies or distributed third-party content change, update
  [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES).

Apply these requirements to all pull requests:

- Preserve partner and community attribution, including names and credits.
- Use placeholders for private values in public configuration and
  documentation.
- Do not commit secrets, local `.env` files, private certificates, token
  caches, generated snapshots, generated runtime state, or private workspace
  details.
- Do not add internal-only links to public documentation.

## Write for a Public Repository

Write all repository content for a public audience. This rule applies to issues,
pull requests, review comments, commit messages, code comments, documentation,
tests, logs, generated artifacts, and uploaded files.

Follow [WRITING.md](WRITING.md) for plain-language guidance. Use the approved
terms in the
[controlled-word list](.agents/skills/_shared/controlled-words.md). These rules
apply to content written by people and coding agents.

Before you publish content, remove or replace all nonpublic information,
including:

- Internal project, environment, profile, host, service, team, or distribution
  list names.
- Private URLs, repository paths, ticket identifiers, and workspace paths.
- Screenshots, logs, configuration values, or commands that expose nonpublic
  information.
- Company-specific shorthand that a public contributor cannot understand.

Use a public, generic description when the exact internal name is not required.
For example, use `enterprise environment`, `private certificate authority`, or
`internal tracking system` as appropriate. Do not publish the original value in
an example, quotation, test fixture, commit history, or pull request discussion.

If public text cannot describe the change safely, coordinate privately with a
maintainer before submission. Coding agents must inspect their proposed output
against these rules before they post or commit it. A human contributor remains
responsible for reviewing agent-generated content before merge. Automated
checks and controlled words do not replace these reviews.

Use these rules during checks:

- If the change does not require an external system for a check, do not contact
  that system.
- If the change does not require a live service for a check, do not start that
  service.
- Before you contact an external system or start a live service, confirm that
  you have the required credentials and authorization.

## Check Your Changes

After you commit your changes, run these commands from the repository root:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_license_headers.py --check
git fetch upstream main
git diff --check upstream/main...HEAD
```

If you have unstaged changes, also run this command:

```bash
git diff --check
```

If you have staged but uncommitted changes, also run this command:

```bash
git diff --cached --check
```

These commands do not replace example-specific verification. For each changed
example, run the checks that its README specifies.

Catalog pull requests that trigger the Pages workflow include a preview
artifact. Matching changes merged to `main` deploy automatically through
GitHub Pages. Maintainers can use the
[catalog deployment runbook](docs/catalog-deployment.md) for setup and
verification.

For a catalog, example-metadata, or Pages change, also run:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --require-hashes -r scripts/catalog-requirements.txt
python3 scripts/fetch_catalog_assets.py
python3 scripts/build_catalog.py --validate-metadata
python3 scripts/build_catalog.py --check
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -p 'test_*.py'
node --test scripts/tests/*.test.mjs
```

Run the documented setup, syntax, unit, configuration, and teardown-safe checks.
A stable check gives the same result when its inputs do not change. A
teardown-safe check does not leave services or temporary resources active.

Use the smallest stable check that shows the changed behavior.

In the pull request description, include this check information:

- The exact commands that you ran.
- The result of each command.
- The verification that you did not complete and the reason.
- The required live, hardware-specific, credentialed, or external-system
  verification that remains.

Before you report that a check passed, run it after the last change that can
affect its result.

When adding, moving, or renaming an example, follow the
[example taxonomy and naming policy](.agents/skills/nemoclaw-community-contributor-examples/references/example-taxonomy.md)
and its linked restructure checklist.

## Add a New Example

Before implementation, discuss the example's location, name, and provenance
with the maintainers. Provenance identifies the example's origin, history,
contributors, and contributor organizations.

Use the canonical [example README template](#example-readme-template) for the
top-level README. The template defines the required opening information. Keep
the expanded sections appropriate for the example and its deployment paths.

Document this information for a new example:

- Its purpose, intended users, and support boundary.
- Its contributor or organizational provenance.
- Its prerequisites and supported environments.
- Its architecture and major components.
- Its credential and secret handling.
- Its setup and configuration.
- Its sandbox, network, and policy permissions.
- Its startup behavior.
- Its verification steps and expected results.
- Its teardown and cleanup.
- Its known limitations.
- Its third-party dependencies and license obligations.

For a documentation-only tutorial, omit runtime-only sections that do not
apply. State that no deployment is required, identify the root `tutorial.md` as
the canonical content source, and document how to build and verify its
published page.

Give readers one recommended start command or action. If the example has
multiple deployment paths, name the lowest-risk or most generally applicable
entry point first and link the alternatives. Do not add an empty `setup.sh`
only to satisfy a filename convention; the documented entry point must perform
the setup it claims to perform.

The catalog discovers a new example from its canonical directory and root
`README.md`; there is no separate manifest to edit. Validate the README block,
then regenerate the human-readable catalog and local Pages build:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_catalog.py --validate-metadata
python3 -m pip install --require-hashes -r scripts/catalog-requirements.txt
python3 scripts/fetch_catalog_assets.py
python3 scripts/build_catalog.py --write
```

Generated detail pages can embed referenced local GIF, JPEG, PNG, and WebP
images. Convert SVG screenshots or diagrams to one of those raster formats, or
link to the SVG source on GitHub; the Pages build does not publish contributed
SVGs as same-origin documents.

Fenced Mermaid diagrams render on generated detail pages when their first line
uses `flowchart`, `graph`, `sequenceDiagram`, or `stateDiagram-v2`. Keep each
diagram under 10,000 characters and each README to at most 10 diagrams. The
build rejects Mermaid configuration and click directives, active HTML,
image/icon shapes, CSS imports, and CSS URL references. Do not load remote
diagram resources. Readers can always expand the retained source, and the
source remains visible when browser rendering is unavailable.

## Category And Collection Indexes

The catalog takes each browse tile's title and description from a standardized
index README. The five canonical category indexes are:

- `examples/recipes/nvidia/README.md`
- `examples/recipes/partners/README.md`
- `examples/recipes/community/README.md`
- `examples/demos/field/README.md`
- `examples/tools/README.md`

Hackathon and Build-a-Claw are cross-cutting discovery collections, not
example paths. Their index-only READMEs are
`examples/collections/hackathon/README.md` and
`examples/collections/build-a-claw/README.md`. Do not place examples under
`examples/collections/`; keep each example in its canonical category path.
Recipes and demos opt into a collection through README metadata. The website
presents each collection as one browse group without changing an example's
artifact type, path, or provenance.

After optional license comments, each index README must start with its public
H1 title, a blank line, and one concise plain-text description paragraph. The
build reads those authored fields for the catalog tile and its information
tooltip. The entire index must use this standardized shape:

```markdown
## Examples

[Generated table or empty-state message.]
```

The build retains the authored title and description values while normalizing
the index structure and regenerating the example list. No other sections are
permitted. Change an individual example's root README metadata and regenerate
the catalog instead of editing that list by hand.

### Tutorial Markdown

Any canonical example can place an exact lowercase `tutorial.md` beside its
root `README.md`. The README remains the catalog metadata and overview source,
while GitHub Pages renders `tutorial.md` as that entry's tutorial detail page.
Without `tutorial.md`, the entry keeps its normal README detail page. Other
Markdown files do not enable tutorial rendering, and an incorrectly cased
variant such as `Tutorial.md` fails validation.

The tutorial renderer uses the first level-one heading as the page title. Each
later level-one heading starts one tutorial step; nested headings remain on that
step. The published page adds progress plus Previous and Next navigation, while
the complete document remains readable when JavaScript is unavailable. It also
adds copy controls and build-time syntax highlighting to fenced code. Put each
fence at the start of a line and give it an explicit language such as `bash`,
`yaml`, or `text`; indented fences are not supported. The renderer suppresses a
standalone `[TOC]` marker because it creates its own navigation. These changes
affect generated HTML only. The build does not rewrite the Markdown source, run
its commands, or validate its technical claims.

Prefer reviewed local images whose publication rights and attribution are
known. The tutorial renderer never loads a remote image automatically. It
replaces a credential-free HTTPS image with an outbound no-referrer link that
names the external host. Remote bytes remain mutable and outside this
repository's availability and provenance boundary. YouTube and LinkedIn are
the only supported iframe hosts. Disclose those external connections before
the first embedded frame; generated frames use lazy loading and a sandbox.

## Catalog Metadata

Each example's root README is the single source for that example in the
generated [Markdown catalog](examples/README.md), GitHub Pages cards, filters,
detail pages, public `catalog.json` search index, and agent-oriented
`llms.txt`. The build discovers example directories from the canonical
taxonomy, derives kind and provenance from the path, and reads this exact table
from the root README. Put it immediately after the level-one title. Existing
final `Catalog Metadata` sections remain supported as a legacy placement.
Non-catalog YAML frontmatter may precede the title and is ignored by catalog
generation:

```markdown
# Recognizable Example Name

| Catalog field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Performs a concrete job and produces an observable result. |
| Industry | ✨ Other |
| Requirements | Linux · Docker · required service or boundary |
| NemoClaw | v0.0.104 |
| Harness | OpenClaw 2026.7.1 |
| OpenShell | 0.0.85 |

[Explain the example and show how to run it.]
```

After `OpenShell`, add optional rows in this order: `Lifecycle`, `Reviewed`,
`Upstream`, `Contributor`, and `Collection`. Omit rows that do not apply. Do
not add YAML frontmatter for catalog data; place all new catalog metadata in
the Markdown table. The
[catalog architecture](docs/catalog-architecture.md) documents the complete
generation and public query contract.

Follow these metadata rules:

- The level-one title is the concise catalog name, must be plain text, and is
  limited to 100 characters.
- `Description` is one plain-text outcome description for catalog and search
  results, limited to 300 characters.
- `Industry` is exactly one emoji-and-title pair from the controlled list below.
  Choose the industry of the workflow, not the contributor, model, hardware,
  or an example dataset. Use `Other` for horizontal workflows.
- `Requirements` is a short, factual summary of the main environment,
  dependency, and material operating boundary. It appears as “Requirements &
  limits” in catalog cards and detail pages and is limited to 240 characters.
- `NemoClaw` is the exact or ranged CLI/bootstrap version that creates the
  example's stack, or `Unpinned`, `Unknown`, or `N/A`. Use `N/A` only when the
  example runs a prebuilt or direct harness stack without invoking NemoClaw.
- `Harness` is `Hermes`, `OpenClaw`, `LangChain Deep Agents`, or
  `LangChain Deep Agents Code` followed by an exact/ranged version,
  `Unpinned`, or `Unknown`. Use `N/A` only when no harness runs as part of the
  example. When several harnesses participate, declare the one that performs
  the example's primary agent workload and describe the others in the body.
- `OpenShell` is an exact/ranged version, `Unpinned`, `Unknown`, or `N/A`. Use
  `N/A` only when no supported path uses OpenShell.
- For multiple supported deployment paths, use an exact version only when all
  paths use it. Use `Unpinned` when any path selects a mutable version, and
  `Unknown` when a used component or its version cannot be established.
- `Lifecycle` is optional and accepts exactly `Active` or `Deprecated`;
  omitting it means `Active`. Use `Deprecated` only when the
  example is intentionally retained for reference instead of recommended for
  new use.
- `Reviewed` is an optional `YYYY-MM-DD` date for a focused review of setup,
  documented behavior, and known limitations. It is maintenance metadata, not
  a verification result or evidence level.
- `Upstream` is optional. Set it only when the example wraps, adapts, or extends
  a separate canonical public project, and use an absolute HTTPS URL without
  embedded credentials. Do not use it as a second source link to this example.
- `Contributor` is required only for partner recipes.
- `Collection` is optional for recipes and demos and accepts exactly one of
  `Hackathon` or `Build-a-Claw`. A collection entry keeps its canonical
  artifact type, path, and provenance.
- The directory path remains the source for artifact kind and recipe
  provenance; do not repeat either in the catalog block.

Do not author the public maintenance status. It is computed from the latest
committed change anywhere under the example or a later `Reviewed` date. This
is a repository-activity heuristic: documentation and asset changes count just
like runtime changes. The age bands are `Current` through day 29, `Review soon`
through day 59, `Review due` through day 119, `Review overdue` through day 239,
and `Review critical` from day 240. The thresholds live in
`scripts/catalog-maintenance.json`, and the daily
Pages build refreshes the site. An authored `Deprecated` lifecycle applies
immediately and is the only status hidden by the default catalog view. An
automatic status never rewrites the README. These signals describe repository
change activity, not support, quality, or runtime health.

### Runtime Stack Discovery

The three README rows are the human fallback; they do not confirm what the
implementation installs. The catalog performs a deliberately small static
check of root `Dockerfile*`, `agents/*/Dockerfile*`, or the standard
`deploy/setup-hermes.sh` used by stock-Hermes deployments.

It recognizes `NEMOCLAW_VERSION`, `NEMOCLAW_COMMIT`,
`NEMOCLAW_INSTALL_TAG`, `NEMOCLAW_INSTALL_REF`, `NEMOCLAW_AGENT`,
`HERMES_VERSION`, `HERMES_SEMVER`, `OPENCLAW_VERSION`,
`DEEPAGENTS_VERSION`, `DEEP_AGENTS_VERSION`,
`LANGCHAIN_DEEP_AGENTS_CODE_VERSION`, and `OPENSHELL_VERSION`. Put standard
runtime values in the Dockerfile or setup script that actually installs the stack:

```dockerfile
ARG NEMOCLAW_VERSION=v0.0.104
ARG NEMOCLAW_COMMIT=f389c9d872775006ae069473f58250fa8f3ad40f
ARG NEMOCLAW_AGENT=openclaw
ARG OPENSHELL_VERSION=0.0.85
```

Do not add a catalog-only version file. Nested or custom deployment layouts
intentionally remain README-only until they adopt one of these conventions.

An exact NemoClaw tag or commit listed in
`scripts/nemoclaw-release-contracts.json` can supply its stock harness and
OpenShell versions once the selected harness is known. An explicit harness
pin overrides the stock harness. Any explicit value must agree with the
README and inferred values. Contract harness values are installed CLI/package
versions, not source-tag aliases. Add a release contract only after checking
the exact upstream commit, harness package metadata, and OpenShell constraint.

The UI reports `Confirmed` when applicable exact values agree with a standard
contract, `Unconfirmed` when exact values exist only in the README, `Unpinned`
for ranges or mutable installs, `Unknown` when a used component or version is
not established, `Conflict` for disagreement, and `N/A` only when the
component does not participate. Unsupported layouts fall back instead of
being guessed. These labels describe version evidence, not quality or
support. Model discovery remains out of scope.

Choose one of these exact industry values, including its emoji:

- `🎓 Academia/Education`
- `🏗️ AEC`
- `🚀 Aerospace`
- `🌾 Agriculture`
- `🚗 Automotive/Transportation`
- `☁️ Cloud Services`
- `🌐 Consumer Internet`
- `⚡ Energy`
- `💳 Financial Services`
- `🎮 Gaming`
- `🖥️ Hardware/Semiconductor`
- `🧬 Health and Life Sciences`
- `🔬 HPC/Scientific Computing`
- `🏭 Manufacturing`
- `🎬 Media & Entertainment`
- `🏛️ Public Sector`
- `🍽️ Restaurant/Quick Service`
- `🛍️ Retail/Consumer Packaged Goods`
- `🏙️ Smart Cities/Spaces`
- `📡 Telecommunications`
- `✨ Other`

The `Validate example README metadata` GitHub check rejects missing root
READMEs, invalid paths, malformed opening blocks, unknown fields, duplicate
titles, and values outside the controlled industry and collection lists. Run it
locally with `python3 scripts/build_catalog.py --validate-metadata`. Do not edit
generated catalog rows or deployed cards by hand.

## Example README Template

Use this template as the required information contract for each new example.
The opening gives a reader the information needed to decide whether to run or
adapt the example. The expanded headings are flexible, but applicable
credential, external-data, permission, cost, destructive-action, and security
disclosures are required.

### Before You Draft

Before drafting, read this entire template, this contributor guide, the
[writing guide](WRITING.md), the [support policy](SUPPORT.md), the
[example taxonomy](.agents/skills/nemoclaw-community-contributor-examples/references/example-taxonomy.md),
and the complete example directory. Inspect its implementation, scripts,
configuration, tests, and existing documentation. Also read one strong README
for a similar example type.

Have your coding agent read the same sources. Ask it to draft from that
evidence, not from an issue description alone. The agent must not invent
commands, results, compatibility, support, security, or performance claims.
Remove secrets and nonpublic information, and use obvious placeholders for
private values. A human contributor must review and correct the draft before
submission.

### Evidence Levels

Choose the lowest level that fully matches the completed verification:

- `live end-to-end`: The intended user workflow completed in the documented
  target environment, including its required live services or hardware.
- `integration`: Multiple connected components were exercised, but the full
  intended workflow or target environment was not.
- `local/static`: Verification was limited to local, unit, syntax,
  configuration, documentation, or other non-live checks.

Do not infer a higher evidence level from intended architecture, partial
results, or unverified contributor claims.

### Copyable Template

<!--
Before drafting, read CONTRIBUTING.md, WRITING.md, the example taxonomy, and
the complete example directory. Replace every placeholder and remove all
authoring comments before submission.

Use "verified on" only when completed evidence supports the exact environment.
Do not substitute "supported on" unless there is an actual support commitment.
Evidence level describes completed verification; it does not establish support

### Required Authoring Rules

- Put material credential, data-sharing, permission, cost, write, or
  destructive-action warnings before the command that triggers them.
- Start with the exact title. Put the catalog table, including its `Description`
  outcome, immediately after the level-one title as documented in
  [Catalog Metadata](#catalog-metadata).
- Use the canonical category independently from contributor or organizational
  provenance.
- Preserve partner and community attribution.
- Distinguish `required`, `designed for`, `verified on`, and `supported`. These
  terms are not interchangeable.
- Use the lowest evidence level that fully matches the completed verification.
- Include expected results as text even when a screenshot shows them.
- Use obvious placeholders for credentials and private values.
- Do not include secrets, internal links, tenant details, private paths, or
  nonpublic environment names.
- Do not use unqualified claims such as "secure," "safe," "production-ready,"
  "easy," or "fast."
- A logo, header graphic, or architecture diagram does not replace the required
  result screenshot.
- Quickstart and verification may link to deployment-specific guides instead of
  duplicating them.
- Remove unused placeholders, authoring comments, and optional sections before
  submission.

### Optional Expanded Sections

Add these sections when they improve the example:

- What this example does.
- Architecture and major components.
- Prerequisites and supported or verified environments.
- Credentials and secret handling.
- Security, data, permissions, network policy, and external side effects.
- Setup and configuration.
- Startup and operation.
- Verification and expected results.
- Teardown and cleanup.
- Troubleshooting.
- Known limitations.
- Provenance, attribution, and support.
- Third-party dependencies and license obligations.

The headings are optional. Applicable credentials, external-data, permissions,
cost, destructive-action, and security disclosures are not optional and must
appear before the relevant action.

## Move or Rename an Example

Before you move or rename an example, complete these steps:

- Search the repository for the old path and name.
- Search open pull requests for the old path and name.
- Identify affected pull requests and downstream documentation.
- Record the merge order.
- Coordinate the update sequence with owners of dependent pull requests.
- Keep path changes separate from unrelated runtime or dependency changes.

In the pull request for the move, complete these steps:

- Add a table that maps each old path to its new path.
- Update links, commands, ownership, notices, and `.gitmodules` entries.
- List identifiers that must keep an old name for compatibility.
- Give instructions for existing clones if a submodule moves.
- Verify each moved example from its new location.
- Remove obsolete paths.

After the migration merges, owners of dependent pull requests must fetch the
updated `main` branch from `upstream`. Then, each owner must merge
`upstream/main` into the pull request branch and push normally.

After each branch update, confirm that the pull request does not restore an
obsolete path.

## Sign Off Every Pull Request

Every pull request description must include a
[`Signed-off-by:` declaration](https://developercertificate.org/) for Developer
Certificate of Origin (DCO) compliance. The pull request author must add the
declaration before requesting review.

Add this line to the pull request description:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

Use your own name and email address. Individual commits may also include
sign-off trailers, but the required check validates the declaration in the pull
request description. The example name and email address do not satisfy the
required check.

DCO sign-off is separate from cryptographic commit signing.

Maintainers do not accept pull requests without the required declaration.

## Open a Pull Request

Complete [.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

Your pull request should include:

- The problem and expected result.
- The examples and repository areas that the change affects.
- The exact check commands and results.
- An explanation for checks that you did not run.
- The documentation and dependency changes.
- For a migration, its details and downstream follow-up work.
- Your DCO sign-off declaration.

Submit all changes to `main` through a pull request.

Do not rewrite the history of a published pull request branch. If a branch
cannot be corrected with new commits or a merge from `main`, replace it with a
new branch and pull request as described in
[Update a Published Branch](#update-a-published-branch).

Maintainers merge a pull request only when all these conditions are true:

- The pull request description satisfies the DCO requirement.
- The pull request satisfies the license-header requirements.
- The pull request has no unresolved review conversations.
- A maintainer approves the pull request.

Maintainers review and merge contributions according to
[GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).

Maintainers may require NVIDIA internal open-source review for these changes:

- A major scope change.
- A new dependency.
- A distribution scope change.
- Publication of a container image.
- A material change to the project license or compliance surface.
