# Example Catalog Architecture

The NemoClaw Community catalog is a generated static site hosted by GitHub
Pages. It has no application server, database, remote JavaScript, or package
runtime. Pinned Python-Markdown and Pygments packages compile example READMEs
and highlight tutorial code into static detail pages. A pinned, hash-verified
Mermaid Tiny browser asset is downloaded at build time and served locally only
on pages that contain diagrams.

```

The standardized catalog block immediately after the level-one title in each
example's root `README.md` is the canonical metadata source. A final
`Catalog Metadata` section remains supported as a legacy placement.
[`scripts/build_catalog.py`](../scripts/build_catalog.py) is the stable
command-line entry point. Its focused modules under `scripts/catalog/`
discover those READMEs from the repository taxonomy, validate their title,
required `Description` table row, industry emoji and title, requirements, and
conditional fields, then derives artifact kind and recipe provenance from each
path. Optional `Lifecycle` and `Reviewed` fields inform maintenance status; an
optional `Upstream` field identifies a separate canonical public project that
the example adapts. The required NemoClaw, harness, and OpenShell rows provide
a readable fallback while standard runtime files provide confirmation.

The compiler follows a one-way pipeline: `sources.py` reads repository inputs;
`listings.py`, `markdown.py`, and `detail_pages.py` render them; `validation.py`
checks the generated result; and `pipeline.py` coordinates publication.
`model.py` contains the shared data model. Presentation sources follow the
parallel layout documented in [`site/README.md`](../site/README.md): templates,
page-specific styles, native browser modules, and static assets.

Any discovered example can place an exact lowercase `tutorial.md` beside its
root README. The README continues to supply catalog metadata and the overview;
`tutorial.md` supplies that entry's detail-page tutorial body without changing
its category, provenance, or collections. Other Markdown files are ignored for
tutorial discovery. Rendering extracts the tutorial's first level-one heading
as the page title and turns each later level-one heading into a paged step with
progress plus Previous and Next navigation. Nested headings stay within their
step. Fenced code is highlighted at build time and gains a copy control. The
full document remains the no-JavaScript fallback, and none of these
transformations write back to the source. The build formats the document but
does not execute or validate its commands.

Each of the five canonical categories and two collections has an index README.
The browsable indexes supply the website label and information tooltip from
their H1 and opening description; the Build-a-Claw collection supplies the one
combined browse group for its demos, tutorials, and tagged recipes. The build
retains those values while rewriting each index into its standardized shape
and regenerating the inventory inside the `## Examples` section. No other
index sections are permitted. Collection directories are indexes only; they
never contain examples. The ignored `_site/` directory is disposable; do not
edit it directly.

The generated HTML contains every example card. The local JavaScript module
filters those cards in the browser, so the full category-organized catalog
remains readable when JavaScript is unavailable. GitHub Pages only serves the
generated files.

## Homepage Discovery Metadata

The catalog homepage publishes one title, description, keyword set, canonical
URL, and Open Graph object from `site/templates/index.html`. The canonical URL
is the approved GitHub Pages root in `scripts/catalog/model.py`. It must use a
standalone `canonical` link relation so it cannot hide a stylesheet, icon,
preload, or other browser-fetched resource from validation.

The Open Graph object uses the same canonical URL and a same-origin, tracked
PNG image with its type, dimensions, and alternative text. The generated-site
validator requires exactly one approved canonical URL, rejects duplicate HTML
attributes, and continues to inventory and reject remote page resources.

Each card links to a static detail page. The build extracts the source-document
title, compiles headings, tables, lists, links, code, and images, and renders
the result inside the shared site theme. Normal detail pages without Mermaid
remain script-free and load only the shared and detail stylesheets. Tutorial
pages additionally load isolated tutorial styles and one local
progressive-enhancement module for code-copy controls and paged navigation.
Pages with supported
Mermaid fences load the pinned local Tiny runtime and progressively replace
each fence with a themed diagram. The original diagram source stays in an
expandable disclosure and is the no-JavaScript or render-error fallback.

The README compiler sanitizes its HTML output. Same-page heading fragments stay
local, links to another catalog README use its local detail route, and other
repository files or directories link to GitHub. Only referenced local images
in GIF, JPEG, PNG, or WebP format are copied into `_site/`, with type, size,
path, and symlink checks. SVG images are rejected because Pages would otherwise
serve contributed active documents from the site origin. Remote README images
become outbound links that name the external host and suppress the referrer;
the reader must choose to open them. Tutorial pages can display supported
YouTube or LinkedIn frames from their author-maintained Markdown. Those frames
receive restricted attributes, lazy loading, and a tutorial-specific Content
Security Policy. The policy permits local images only, and all tutorial scripts
come from this repository.

Mermaid publication uses a deliberately narrow subset: flowcharts, graphs,
sequence diagrams, and state diagrams. The build caps source size and diagram
count and rejects configuration, click handlers, active HTML, image/icon
shapes, CSS imports, and CSS resource URLs. Rendering uses Mermaid's
sandbox security level. The catalog then validates the generated SVG,
places it in a permissionless `srcdoc` iframe, and applies parent and iframe
Content Security Policies. The parent policy blocks outbound connections and
nonlocal resources. The iframe policy blocks scripts and network-loaded
resources. The runtime bundle is version pinned, SHA-256 verified before
publication, and never loaded from a CDN by a reader's browser.

## Independent Discovery Dimensions

The catalog keeps these concepts separate:

- `kind` is `recipe`, `demo`, or `tool` and comes from the canonical path.
- `provenance` is `nvidia`, `partner`, or `community`, applies only to recipes,
  and also comes from the canonical path.
- `industry` is one required controlled emoji-and-title value on every example,
  independent of kind and provenance.
- `lifecycle` is an optional authored value: `Active` or `Deprecated`.
  Omission means `Active`; it never belongs in an example path.
- `reviewed` is an optional focused maintenance-review date, not runtime
  verification evidence.
- `stack` merges required README declarations with a small static check of
  standardized runtime files.
- `collection` is a cross-cutting discovery field. Recipes and demos opt in
  through metadata. A collection never replaces kind, provenance, canonical
  path, or contributor attribution.

The build rejects unknown taxonomy roots, unsafe or invalid example paths,
canonical example directories without a root README, malformed metadata
blocks, duplicate titles, and values outside the controlled vocabulary.

## Static Stack Discovery

Every README declares `NemoClaw`, `Harness`, and `OpenShell`. The builder then
looks for matching values only in root `Dockerfile*`, `agents/*/Dockerfile*`,
or the stock-Hermes `deploy/setup-hermes.sh`. It recognizes a short list of
conventional variables documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`; other custom layouts
use the README fallback until standardized.

The checked-in `scripts/nemoclaw-release-contracts.json` maps reviewed exact
NemoClaw tags and commits to their stock harness matrix and OpenShell version.
The builder can infer those values once it finds an exact release and selected
harness. Contract harness values use installed CLI/package versions. Explicit
implementation pins take precedence and must agree with the README.

The final state is `Confirmed`, `Unconfirmed`, `Unpinned`, `Unknown`,
`Conflict`, or `N/A`. This is a version-evidence statement, not a support,
quality, or runtime-health claim. Catalog builds never fetch release metadata,
and model discovery is out of scope.

## Computed Maintenance Status

Contributors may author `Lifecycle` and a focused `Reviewed` date, but not the
public status. The effective activity date is the latest committed change
anywhere under the example or a later review. This is deliberately a
repository-activity heuristic: documentation and asset changes count as well
as runtime changes. The age-only bands are `Current` through
day 29, `Review soon` through day 59, `Review due` through day 119, `Review
overdue` through day 239, and `Review critical` from day 240. An authored
`Deprecated` lifecycle applies immediately and is the only status hidden by
the default catalog view. Computed maintenance never edits the README.
Thresholds are maintained in `scripts/catalog-maintenance.json`, and the
scheduled Pages workflow refreshes them daily. The build requires full Git
history; a newly added, uncommitted example temporarily uses the build date for
local preview. Maintenance status is independent of stack verification and is
not a support or runtime-health claim.

## Browser Search Contract

Catalog state is encoded in the URL so a filtered view can be copied,
bookmarked, or created by another program:

| Parameter | Values | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `q` | Plain text | Case-insensitive whitespace-token AND search across title, description, requirements, category and provenance display text, industry, lifecycle, maintenance status, stack values and verification, contributor, and collections. |
| `view` | `category` or `industry` | Selects which discovery dimension is active. The default is `category`. |
| `category` | `all`, `nvidia-recipes`, `partner-recipes`, `community-recipes`, `nvidia-field-demos`, `developer-tools`, `hackathon-recipes`, or `build-a-claw` | Applies in category view. `hackathon-recipes` selects tagged recipes; `build-a-claw` combines its canonical demos/tutorials with tagged recipes. |
| `industry` | `all` or an industry ID published in `catalog.json` | Applies in industry view. |
| `maintenance` | `maintained`, `all`, `current`, `review-soon`, `review-due`, `review-overdue`, `review-critical`, or `deprecated` | Applies independently of the active browse view. `maintained` includes every status except explicit deprecation. |

Examples:

```text
https://nvidia.github.io/nemoclaw-community/?q=payment&view=industry&industry=financial-services
https://nvidia.github.io/nemoclaw-community/?q=slack&category=nvidia-recipes
```

Unknown values are removed and replaced with defaults. Search typing updates
the current history entry; deliberate view and filter changes create history
entries, so browser Back and Forward restore prior views. Existing category
and example fragments for the supported taxonomy remain valid.

## Machine-Readable Catalog

[`https://nvidia.github.io/nemoclaw-community/catalog.json`](https://nvidia.github.io/nemoclaw-community/catalog.json)
publishes a deterministic JSON index containing:

- category IDs, labels, descriptions, kinds, provenance, and counts;
- every allowed industry ID, label, emoji, and current count;
- collection IDs, labels, descriptions, and counts;
- each example's title, description, category, kind, recipe provenance,
  industry, lifecycle, optional reviewed date, NemoClaw, harness, and OpenShell
  facts, stack verification and evidence paths, computed maintenance status,
  contributor when applicable, collections, requirements, optional upstream
  project URL, source path, source guide URL, and local detail URL.

This is a static index rather than a server-side query API. A program can fetch
it once and apply its own filters, or construct a browser URL using the query
contract above.

## Agent-Oriented Text Index

[`https://nvidia.github.io/nemoclaw-community/llms.txt`](https://nvidia.github.io/nemoclaw-community/llms.txt)
publishes the catalog overview, filter guidance, category and collection
fields, and one concise record for every example. Each record includes the
example's category, industry, requirements, lifecycle, NemoClaw, harness, and
OpenShell facts, stack verification, maintenance status, detail page, source
guide, collections, and optional upstream project.

The build creates `llms.txt` directly from the same validated README data used
for `catalog.json`; it is a second generated representation, not a metadata
source or a file contributors edit. Programs that need typed fields and counts
should continue to use `catalog.json`.

## Update And Verify

After changing an example README catalog block or a consumed runtime stack
source, validate the inputs, then regenerate the committed Markdown catalog
and local site:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_catalog.py --validate-metadata
python3 -m pip install --require-hashes -r scripts/catalog-requirements.txt
python3 scripts/fetch_catalog_assets.py
python3 scripts/build_catalog.py --write
```

Run the same checks used by the Pages workflow:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_catalog.py --check
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -p 'test_*.py'
node --test scripts/tests/*.test.mjs
```

For local browser verification, follow the
[`catalog-deployment.md`](catalog-deployment.md#build-locally) instructions.
